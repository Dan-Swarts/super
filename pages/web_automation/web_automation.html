            <h1>A Repetitive task</h1>

            <p>I am very fond of this project, as it is not for school or work. This repository 
            contains code that automates a repetitive task that has been a personal challenge for me: 
            completing quizzes for a daily reward. I completed these quizzes for my free crowns EVERY 
            DAY. While Experiencing the mind-numbing, boring, tedious, and repetitive task once again, 
            the realization struck that these could be effortlessly solved by a machine.</p>
        
            <h1>Selenium</h1>

            <p>After some research, I discovered Selenium, a powerful Python package capable of 
            automating various networking processes.</p>

            <p>Basic proficiency in networking, web pages, and HTML code was needed to complete the 
            code. I implemented my basic functions in "web.py."</p>      
            
            <h1>Multithreading</h1>

            <p>One of the most fascinating concepts applied during this project was multithreading. 
            This technique allowed the splitting of the automation process into multiple concurrent 
            processes, enabling the bot to solve multiple quizzes simultaneously. For a look at the 
            implementation, refer to "main.py."</p>
            
            <h1>Recording the Answers</h1>

            <p>The first step in building the automated solution was recording the correct answers to 
            enable the machine to score well. This was accomplished by designing a system that 
            automatically scanned and extracted the questions and answers into a dictionary. Each
            question served as a key, paired with its corresponding multiple choice answers, and the 
            resulting dictionary was stored in a JSON file. The implementation can be found in the 
            "download_quizzes.py."</p>
           
            <h1>Manual Review</h1>

            <p>I manually eliminated the incorrect answers. It is acknowledged that 2-3 answers within 
            the Ancient Egypt trivia section are inaccurate. However, since achieving 9 out of 12 
            correct answers suffices to pass the quiz, rectifying these errors is pointless.</p>
            
                
            <h1>Solving the Quizzes</h1>

            <p>After completing the previous steps, continuous refinement and iteration were undertaken 
            to create "solve_quizzes.py." This script now reliably fulfills solves the quizzes using 
            the answers from the json files.</p>
