            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            
            <p>My name is Daniel Swarts. I love movies, hiking, and nature. Software Development is 
            a lot like a hike; a long, tedious process filled with bugs. This hike taught me grit, 
            problem solving, and teamwork, which I use to pioneer the landscape of software and 
            technology.<p>
            
            <p>Throughout my years of coding experience, I have 
            honed my skills within collaborative environments, leveraging platforms like GitHub to 
            work seamlessly with teams using planning, effective Communication, and parallel 
            development. This exposure has allowed me to become proficient in Problem-solving with 
            various programming languages, while also delving into the realms of data analysis and 
            machine learning.<p>

            <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to learning 
            more about the position and your companyâ€™s vision. I am excited to contribute my skills 
            and enthusiasm to your team. I am confident that my blend of technical expertise, 
            adaptability, and unwavering determination will make me a valuable asset in driving your 
            company's success.</p>
