                    This project was a collaborative group effort written in c++. Together me 
                    and my three parteners made the canny edge detection filter.

                <h1>Canny Edge Detection: An Overview</h1>
                <p>
                    Canny Edge Detection is a sophisticated computer vision algorithm designed 
                    to extract sharp edges from an image while disregarding other details. The 
                    algorithm produces the following output:

                <h1>Implementation Details</h1>
                <p>
                    The Canny edge detection algorithm involves applying a series of carefully 
                    chosen filters that work in tandem to achieve the desired output. These 
                    filters include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Grayscale Conversion:</b>The grayscale filter transforms a color 
                        image into grey by converting each pixel's color value into a 
                        corresponding gray intensity value. This step is crucial because it 
                        simplifies the image to a single color channel, making it easier to 
                        detect edges based on intensity variations.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Gaussian Blur:</b>The Gaussian blur filter applies a blur to the 
                        grayscale image using a Gaussian kernel. This blurring process reduces 
                        noise and smoothens the image, which helps to eliminate small 
                        fluctuations in intensity that could be mistaken for edges. The amount 
                        of blurring is controlled by the size of the kernel and the standard 
                        deviation parameter.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Sobel Operator:</b>The Sobel operator is an edge-detection filter 
                        that calculates the gradient of the grayscale image in both the 
                        horizontal and vertical directions. It highlights regions of rapid 
                        intensity changes, representing potential edges. By computing the 
                        gradient magnitude and direction, the Sobel operator identifies the 
                        strength and orientation of edges in the image.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Double Thresholding:</b>Double thresholding is a technique where 
                        the image is segmented into different intensity regions based on two 
                        threshold values: a high threshold and a low threshold. Pixels with 
                        intensity values above the high threshold are considered strong edges,
                        while those below the low threshold are regarded as non-edges. Pixels 
                        with values between the two thresholds are classified as weak edges.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Hysteresis Thresholding:</b>Hysteresis thresholding is the final 
                        step in the Canny edge detection process. It aims to refine the edges 
                        obtained from double thresholding by connecting and preserving only 
                        the strong edges while suppressing weak or noisy edges. It achieves 
                        this by analyzing the connectivity between pixels and determining if 
                        they form continuous edge contours.
