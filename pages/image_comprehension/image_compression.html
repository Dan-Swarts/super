                <h1>K-Means and EM for Image Compression</h1>
                <P>
                    Do you have 5,000 pictures on your phone? Do you wish that you could fold, or 
                    squish them so that you fit more? well we can use some statistical magic to achieve image compression without significant loss in quality.
                </P>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h1>How does it work?</h1>
                <P>
                    A pixel typically takes up 3 bytes of data: 1 byte for the R, G ,and B values
                    which make up the color. But the truth is we don't actually need all that space.
                    Colors are sparse: most of them never get used. Instead of getting 3x256 possible
                    colors, we can get away with just k colors.
                </P>

                    Would you believe that the image on the right is 1,000 times smaller than the
                    image on the left? Well, it's true: because it uses only 16 colors.

            <div>
                <h1>K Means</h1>
                <p>We can achieve this by conceptualizing the color domain as a 3D euclidean space<br>
                where the axes are the color channels:</p>
                <img src="RGB_plot.png" class="asset">
                <p>Then we plot all the pixels and use k-means clustering to find k clusters</p>

            <div>
                <h1>EM Algorithm</h1>
                <p>
                    to this point, we have assumed that the colors are independent from one another.
                    that is, it follows k independent normal distributions. However we use the EM
                    algorithm to account for correlation between the different distributions. The
                    expectation step will calculate the "responsibility" of each pixel to its cluster,
                    or the probability that the pixel belongs to each cluster.in the maximization step,
                    we then update the covariance matrix of the multivariate distribution to maximize the
                    probability that these pixels exist this way. After iterating the EM steps, we will
                    account for dependence between color clusters.
